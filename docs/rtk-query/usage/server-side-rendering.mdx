# Server Side Rendering

## Server Side Rendering with Next.js

RTK Query supports Server Side Rendering (SSR) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) via
[rehydration](./persistence-and-rehydration.mdx) in combination with
[next-redux-wrapper](https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper).

The workflow is as follows:

- Set up `next-redux-wrapper`
- In `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`:
  - Pre-fetch all queries via the `initiate` actions, e.g. `store.dispatch(api.endpoints.getPokemonByName.initiate(name))`
  - Wait for each query to finish using `await Promise.all(api.getRunningOperationPromises())`
- In your `createApi` call, configure rehydration using the `extractRehydrationInfo` option:

  [examples](docblock://query/createApi.ts?token=CreateApiOptions.extractRehydrationInfo)

:::tip
While memory leaks are not anticipated, once a render is sent to the client and the store is being
removed from memory, you may wish to also call `store.dispatch(api.util.resetApiState())` to
ensure that no rogue timers are left running.

An example repo using `next.js` is available [here](https://github.com/phryneas/ssr-experiments/tree/main/nextjs-blog).

## Server Side Rendering elsewhere

If you are not using `next.js`, and the example above cannot be adapted to your SSR framework,
an `unstable__` marked approach is available to support SSR scenarios that render the full tree
multiple times until nothing changes any more. Doing so might require async code to be triggered
during render and not safely in an effect.

The workflow is as follows:

- Create a version of `createApi` that performs asynchronous work during render:

  [examples](docblock://query/react/module.ts?token=ReactHooksModuleOptions.unstable__sideEffectsInRender)

- Use your custom `createApi` when calling `const api = createApi({...})`
- Wait for all queries to finish using `await Promise.all(api.getRunningOperationPromises())` before performing the next render cycle
