# Server Side Rendering

## Server Side Rendering with Next.js

RTK Query supports Server Side Rendering (SSR) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) via
[rehydration](./persistence-and-rehydration.mdx) in combination with
[next-redux-wrapper](https://github.com/kirill-konshin/next-redux-wrapper).

The workflow is as follows:

- Set up `next-redux-wrapper`
- In `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`:
  - Pre-fetch all queries via the `initiate` actions, e.g. `store.dispatch(api.endpoints.getPokemonByName.initiate(name))`
  - Wait for each query to finish using `await Promise.all(api.util.getRunningOperationPromises())`
- In your `createApi` call, configure rehydration using the `extractRehydrationInfo` option:

  [examples](docblock://query/createApi.ts?token=CreateApiOptions.extractRehydrationInfo)

An example repo using `next.js` is available [here](https://github.com/phryneas/ssr-experiments/tree/main/nextjs-blog).

:::tip
While memory leaks are not anticipated, once a render is sent to the client and the store is being
removed from memory, you may wish to also call `store.dispatch(api.util.resetApiState())` to
ensure that no rogue timers are left running.

:::tip
In order to avoid providing stale data with Static Site Generation (SSG), you may wish to set
[`refetchOnMountOrArgChange`](../api/createApi.mdx#refetchonmountorargchange) to a reasonable value
such as 900 (seconds) in order to allow data to be re-fetched when accessed if it has been that
long since the page was generated.

## Server Side Rendering elsewhere

If you are not using `next.js`, and the example above cannot be adapted to your SSR framework,
an `unstable__` marked approach is available to support SSR scenarios where you need to execute
async code during render and not safely in an effect.
This is a similar approach to using [`getDataFromTree`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/performance/server-side-rendering/#executing-queries-with-getdatafromtree)
with [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/).

The workflow is as follows:

- Create a version of `createApi` that performs asynchronous work during render:

  [examples](docblock://query/react/module.ts?token=ReactHooksModuleOptions.unstable__sideEffectsInRender)

- Use your custom `createApi` when calling `const api = createApi({...})`
- Wait for all queries to finish using `await Promise.all(api.util.getRunningOperationPromises())` before performing the next render cycle
