# Persistence and Rehydration

RTK Query supports rehydration via the [`extractRehydrationInfo`](../api/createApi.mdx#extractrehydrationinfo)
option on [`createApi`](../api/createApi.mdx). This function is passed every dispatched action,
and where it returns a value other than `undefined`, that value is used to rehydrate the API state
for fulfilled & errored queries.

See also [Server Side Rendering](./server-side-rendering.mdx).

:::info

Generally, persisting API slices is not recommended and instead, mechanisms like
[`Cache-Control` Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control)
should be used in browsers to define cache behaviour.
Persisting and rehydrating an api slice might always leave the user with very stale data if the user
has not visited the page for some time.
Nonetheless, in environments like Native Apps, where there is no browser cache to take care of this,
persistance might still be a viable option.

## Redux Persist

API state rehydration can be used in conjunction with [Redux Persist](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist)
by leveraging the `REHYDRATE` action type imported from `redux-persist`. This can be used out of the
box with the `autoMergeLevel1` or `autoMergeLevel2` [state reconcilers](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist#state-reconciler)
when persisting the root reducer, or with the `autoMergeLevel1` reconciler when persisting just the api reducer.

```ts title="redux-persist rehydration example"
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
import { REHYDRATE } from 'redux-persist'

export const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),
  // highlight-start
  extractRehydrationInfo(action, { reducerPath }) {
    if (action.type === REHYDRATE) {
      return action.payload[reducerPath]
    }
  },
  // highlight-end
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    // omitted
  }),
})
```
