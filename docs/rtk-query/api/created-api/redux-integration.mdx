# API Slices: Redux Integration

Internally, `createApi` will call [the Redux Toolkit `createSlice` API](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice) to generate a slice reducer and corresponding action creators with the appropriate logic for caching fetched data. It also automatically generates a custom Redux middleware that manages subscription counts and cache lifetimes.

The generated slice reducer and the middleware both need to be added to your Redux store setup in `configureStore` in order to work correctly: test

```ts title="src/store.ts"
// file: src/services/pokemon.ts noEmit
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'

export const pokemonApi = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),
  endpoints: () => ({}),
})

// file: src/store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { setupListeners } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { pokemonApi } from './services/pokemon'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    // Add the generated reducer as a specific top-level slice
    [pokemonApi.reducerPath]: pokemonApi.reducer,
  },
  // Adding the api middleware enables caching, invalidation, polling,
  // and other useful features of `rtk-query`.
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) =>
    getDefaultMiddleware().concat(pokemonApi.middleware),
})

// configure listeners using the provided defaults
setupListeners(store.dispatch)
```

## `reducerPath`

```ts no-transpile
reducerPath: string
```

Contains the `reducerPath` option provided to `createApi`. Use this as the root state key when adding the `reducer` function to the store so that the rest of the generated API logic can find the state correctly.

## `reducer`

```ts no-transpile
reducer: Reducer
```

A standard Redux slice reducer function containing the logic for updating the cached data. Add this to the Redux store using the `reducerPath` you provided as the root state key.

## `middleware`

```ts no-transpile
middleware: Middleware
```

A custom Redux middleware that contains logic for managing caching, invalidation, subscriptions, polling, and more. Add this to the store setup after other middleware.
