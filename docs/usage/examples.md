# Examples and Tutorials

We don't yet have any purpose-built examples to show off. We _do_ want to add example projects and tutorials - see
[issue #99](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-starter-kit/issues/99) for discussion.

There are a few small project examples and tutorials out in the community thus far. We'll provide links to those here
for now until we have a chance to specifically create some examples

## Example Projects

Mark Erikson has converted a couple of other people's projects to use Redux Starter Kit, to help show the process
and how much simpler the code can be when using RSK.
