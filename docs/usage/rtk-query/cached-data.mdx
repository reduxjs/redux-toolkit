# Cached Data

A key feature of RTK Query is it's management of cached data. When data is fetched from the server, RTK Query will store the data in the Redux store as a 'cache'. When an additional request is performed for the same data, RTK Query will provide the existing cached data rather than sending an additional request to the server.

RTK Query provides a number of concepts and tools to manipulate the cache behaviour and adjust it to your needs.

## Definitions

### Tags

_see also: [tagTypes API reference](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#tagtypes)_

For RTK Query, _tags_ are just a name that you can give to a specific collection of data to control caching and invalidation behavior for refetching purposes. It can be considered as a 'label' attached to cached data that is read after a `mutation`, to decide whether the data should be affected by the mutation.

Tags are defined in the `tagTypes` argument when defining an api. For example, in an application that has both `Posts` and `Users`, you might define `tagTypes: ['Post', 'User']` when calling `createApi`.

An individual `tag` has a `type`, represented as a `string` name, and an optional `id`, represented as a `string` or `number`. It can be represented as a plain string (such as `'Post'`), or an object in the shape `{type: string, id?: string|number}` (such as `[{type: 'Post', id: 1}]`).

### Providing tags

_see also: [providesTags API reference](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#providestags)_

A _query_ can have it's cached data _provide_ tags. Doing so determines which 'tag' is attached to the cached data returned by the query.

The `providesTags` argument can either be an array of `string` (such as `['Post']`), `{type: string, id?: string|number}` (such as `[{type: 'Post', id: 1}]`), or a callback that returns such an array. That function will be passed the result as the first argument, the response error as the second argument, and the argument originally passed into the `query` method as the third argument. Note that either the result or error arguments may be undefined based on whether the query was successful or not.

### Invalidating tags

_see also: [invalidatesTags API reference](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#invalidatesTags)_

A _mutation_ can _invalidate_ specific cached data based on the tags. Doing so determines which cached data will be either refetched or removed from the cache.

The `invalidatesTags` argument can either be an array of `string` (such as `['Post']`), `{type: string, id?: string|number}` (such as `[{type: 'Post', id: 1}]`), or a callback that returns such an array. That function will be passed the result as the first argument, the response error as the second argument, and the argument originally passed into the `query` method as the third argument. Note that either the result or error arguments may be undefined based on whether the mutation was successful or not.

## Default cache handling behaviour

With RTK Query, caching is based on:
- API endpoint definitions
- The serialized query parameters used when components subscribe to data from an endpoint
- Active subscription reference counts

When a subscription is started, the parameters used with the endpoint are serialized and stored internally as a `queryCacheKey` for the request. Any future request that produces the same `queryCacheKey` (i.e. called with the same parameters, factoring serialization) will be de-duped against the original, and will share the same data and updates. i.e. two separate components performing the same request will use the same cached data.

When a request is attempted, if the data already exists in the cache, then that data is served and no new request is sent to the server. Otherwise, if the data does not exist in the cache, then a new request is sent, and the returned response is stored in the cache.

As long as there is an active 'subscription' to the data (e.g. if a component is mounted that calls a `useQuery` hook for the endpoint), then the data will remain in the cache. Once the subscription is removed (e.g. when last component subscribed to the data unmounts), after an amount of time (default 60 seconds), the data will be removed from the cache. The expiration time can be configured with the `keepUnusedDataFor` property for the [API definition as a whole](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#keepunuseddatafor), as well as on a [per-endpoint](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#anatomy-of-an-endpoint) basis.

### Cache lifetime & subscription example

Imagine an endpoint that expects an `id` as the query param, and 4 components mounted which are requesting data from this same endpoint:

```ts no-transpile
import { useGetUserQuery } from './api.ts'

function ComponentOne() {
  // component subscribes to the data
  const { data } = useGetUserQuery(1)

  return <div>...</div>
}

function ComponentTwo() {
  // component subscribes to the data
  const { data } = useGetUserQuery(2)

  return <div>...</div>
}

function ComponentThree() {
  // component subscribes to the data
  const { data } = useGetUserQuery(3)

  return <div>...</div>
}

function ComponentFour() {
  // component subscribes to the *same* data as ComponentThree,
  // as it has the same query parameters
  const { data } = useGetUserQuery(3)

  return <div>...</div>
}
```

While four components are subscribed to the endpoint, there are only three distinct combinations of endpoint + query parameters. Query parameters `1` and `2` will each have a single subscriber, while query parameter `3` has two subscribers. RTK Query will make three distinct fetches; one for each unique set of query parameters per endpoint.

Data is kept in the cache as long is there is at least one active subscriber interested in that endpoint + parameter combination. When the subscriber reference count reaches zero, a timer is set, and if there are no new subscriptions to that data by the time the timer expires, the cached data will be removed. The default expiration is 60 seconds, which can be configured both for the [API definition as a whole](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#keepunuseddatafor), as well as on a [per-endpoint](../../api/rtk-query/createApi.mdx#anatomy-of-an-endpoint) basis.

If 'ComponentThree' is unmounted in the example above, regardless of how much time passes, the data will remain in the cache due to 'ComponentFour' still being subscribed to the same data, and the subscribe reference count will be `one`. However, once 'ComponentFour' unmounts, the subscriber reference count will be `zero`. The data will remain in the cache for the remainder of the expiration time, at which point, if no new subscription has been created during that time, the cached data will finally be removed.

## Cache tags

RTK Query uses the concept of 'tags' to determine whether a mutation for one endpoint intends to 'invalidate' some data that was 'provided' by a query from another endpoint.

If cache data is being invalidated, it will either refetch the providing query (if components are still using that data) or remove the data from the cache.

When defining an `api`, `createApi` accepts an array of tag type names for the `tagTypes` property, which is a list of possible tag name options that the queries for the `api` could provide.

The example below declares that endpoints can possibly provide 'Posts' and/or 'Users' to the cache:

```ts title="Example of declaring cache tags"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  // highlight-start
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  // highlight-end
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => '/posts',
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => '/users',
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Omit<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
    editPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post> & Pick<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
  }),
})
```

By declaring these tags as what can possibly be provided to the cache, it enables control for individual mutation endpoints to claim whether they affect specific portions of the cache or not, in conjunction with `providesTags` and `invalidatesTags` on individual endpoints.

### Providing cache data

Each individual `query` endpoint can have it's cached data `provide` particular tags. Doing so enables a relationship between cached data from one or more `query` endpoints and the behaviour of one or more `mutation` endpoints.

The `providesTags` property on a `query` endpoint is used for this purpose.

> **Note**
>
> Provided tags have no inherent relationship across separate `query` endpoints. Provided tags are used to determine whether cached data returned by an endpoint should be `invalidated` and either be refetched or removed from the cache. If two separate endpoints provide the same tags, they will still contribute their own distinct cached data, which could later both be invalidated by a single tag declared from a mutation.

The example below declares that the `getPosts` `query` endpoint `provides` the `'Post'` tag to the cache, using the `providesTags` property for a `query` endpoint.

```ts title="Example of providing tags to the cache"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => '/posts',
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: ['Post'],
      // highlight-end
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => '/users',
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: ['User'],
      // highlight-end
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Omit<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
    editPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post> & Pick<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
  }),
})
```

For more granular control over the provided data, provided `tags` can have an associated `id`. This enables a distinction between 'any of a particular tag type', and 'a specific instance of a particular tag type'.

The example below declares that the provided posts are associated with particular IDs as determined by the result returned by the endpoint:

```ts title="Example of providing tags with IDs to the cache"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => '/posts',
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: (result, error, arg) =>
        result
          ? [...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Post' as const, id })), 'Post']
          : ['Post'],
      // highlight-end
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => '/users',
      providesTags: ['User'],
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Omit<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
    editPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post> & Pick<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
    }),
  }),
})
```

Note that for the example above, the `id` is used where possible on a successful result. In the case of an error, no result is supplied, and we still consider that it has provided the general `'Post'` tag type rather than any specific instance of that tag.

:::tip Advanced List Invalidation
In order to provide stronger control over invalidating the appropriate data, you can use an arbitrary ID such a `'LIST'` for a given tag. See [Advanced Invalidation with abstract tag IDs](#advanced-invalidation-with-abstract-tag-ids) for additional details.
:::

### Invalidating cache data

Each individual mutation endpoint can `invalidate` particular tags for existing cached data. Doing so enables a relationship between cached data from one or more query endpoints and the behaviour of one or more mutation endpoints.

The `invalidatesTags` property on a mutation endpoint is used for this purpose.

The example below declares that the `addPost` and `editPost` mutation endpoints `invalidate` any cached data with the `'Post'` tag, using the `invalidatesTags` property for a mutation endpoint:

```ts title="Example of invalidating tags in the cache"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => '/posts',
      providesTags: (result, error, arg) =>
        result
          ? [...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Post' as const, id })), 'Post']
          : ['Post'],
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => '/users',
      providesTags: ['User'],
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Omit<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
      // highlight-start
      invalidatesTags: ['Post'],
      // highlight-end
    }),
    editPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post> & Pick<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
      // highlight-start
      invalidatesTags: ['Post'],
      // highlight-end
    }),
  }),
})
```

For the example above, this tells RTK Query that after the `addPost` and/or `editPost` mutations are called and completed, any cache data supplied with the `'Post'` tag is no longer valid. If a component is currently subscribed to the cached data for a `'Post'` tag after the above mutations are called and complete, it will automatically re-fetch in order to retrieve up to date data from the server.

An example scenario would be like so:

1. A component is rendered which is using the `useGetPostsQuery()` hook to subscribe to that endpoint's cached data
2. The `/posts` request is fired off, and server responds with posts with IDs 1, 2 & 3
3. The `getPosts` endpoint stores the received data in the cache, and internally registers that the following tags have been provided:
   <!-- prettier-ignore -->
   ```js
   [
     { type: 'Post', id: 1 },
     { type: 'Post', id: 2 },
     { type: 'Post', id: 3 },
   ]
   ```
4. The `editPost` mutation is fired off to alter a particular post
5. Upon completion, RTK Query internally registers that the `'Post'` tag is now invalidated, and removes the previously provided `'Post'` tags from the cache
6. Since the `getPosts` endpoint has provided tags of type `'Post'` which now has invalid cache data, and the component is still subscribed to the data, the `/posts` request is automatically fired off again, fetching new data and registering new tags for the updated cached data

For more granular control over the invalidated data, invalidated `tags` can have an associated `id` in the same manner as `providesTags`. This enables a distinction between 'any of a particular tag type' and 'a specific instance of a particular tag type'.

The example below declares that the `editPost` mutation invalidates a specific instance of a `Post` tag, using the ID passed in when calling the mutation function:

```ts title="Example of invalidating tags with IDs to the cache"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({
    baseUrl: '/',
  }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => '/posts',
      providesTags: (result, error, arg) =>
        result
          ? [...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Post' as const, id })), 'Post']
          : ['Post'],
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => '/users',
      providesTags: ['User'],
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Omit<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: 'posts',
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
      invalidatesTags: ['Post'],
    }),
    editPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post> & Pick<Post, 'id'>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts/${body.id}`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
      // highlight-start
      invalidatesTags: (result, error, arg) => [{ type: 'Post', id: arg.id }],
      // highlight-end
    }),
  }),
})
```

For the example above, rather than invalidating any tag with the type `'Post'`, calling the `editPost` mutation function will now only invalidate a tag for the provided `id`. I.e. if cached data from an endpoint does not provide a `'Post'` for that same `id`, it will remain considered as 'valid', and will not be triggered to automatically re-fetch.

:::tip Using abstract tag IDs
In order to provide stronger control over invalidating the appropriate data, you can use an arbitrary ID such a `'LIST'` for a given tag. See [Advanced Invalidation with abstract tag IDs](#advanced-invalidation-with-abstract-tag-ids) for additional details.

  </tbody>
</table>

The invalidation behavior can be summarized like so:

**General tag**

e.g. `['Post'] / [{ type: 'Post' }]`

Will `invalidate` any `provided` tag with the matching type, including general and specific tags.

Example:  
If a general tag of `Post` was invalidated, endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would all have their data invalidated:

- `['Post']`
- `[{ type: 'Post' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post' }, { type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'User' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`

Endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would _not_ have their data invalidated:

- `['User']`
- `[{ type: 'User' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }, { type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`

**Specific tag**

e.g. `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`

Will `invalidate` any `provided` tag with both the matching type, _and_ matching id. Will not cause a `general` tag to be invalidated directly, but _might_ invalidate data for an endpoint that provides a `general` tag _if_ it also provides a matching `specific` tag.

Example 1:
If a specific tag of `{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }` was invalidated, endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would all have their data invalidated:

- `[{ type: 'Post' }, { type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'User' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`

Endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would _not_ have their data invalidated:

- `['Post']`
- `[{ type: 'Post' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `['User']`
- `[{ type: 'User' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }, { type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`

Example 2:
If a specific tag of `{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }` was invalidated, endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would all have their data invalidated:

- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }]`

Endpoints whose data `provided` the following tags would _not_ have their data invalidated:

- `['Post']`
- `[{ type: 'Post' }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post' }, { type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'Post', id: 1 }, { type: 'User' }]`
- `['User']`
- `[{ type: 'User' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`
- `[{ type: 'User', id: 1 }, { type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }]`

## Recipes

### Advanced Invalidation with abstract tag IDs

While using an 'entity ID' for a `tag id` is a common use case, the `id` property is not intended to be limited to database IDs alone. The `id` is simply a way to label a subset of a particular collection of data for a particular `tag type`.

A powerful use-case is to use an ID like `'LIST'` as a label for data provided by a bulk query, _as well as_ using entity IDs for the individual items. Doing so allows future `mutations` to declare whether they invalidate the data only if it contains a particular item (e.g. `{ type: 'Post', id: 5 }`), or invalidate the data if it is a `'LIST'` (e.g. `{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }`).

> **Note about 'LIST' and `id`s**
>
> 1. `LIST` is an arbitrary string - technically speaking, you could use anything you want here, such as `ALL` or `*`. The important thing when choosing a custom id is to make sure there is no possibility of it colliding with an id that is returned by a query result. If you have unknown ids in your query results and don't want to risk it, you can go with point 3 below.
> 2. You can add _many_ tag types for even more control
>    - `[{ type: 'Posts', id: 'LIST' }, { type: 'Posts', id: 'SVELTE_POSTS' }, { type: 'Posts', id: 'REACT_POSTS' }]`
> 3. If the concept of using an `id` like 'LIST' seems strange to you, you can always add another `tagType` and invalidate it's root, but we recommend using the `id` approach as shown.

We can compare the scenarios below to see how using a `'LIST'` id can be leveraged to optimize behaviour.

#### Invalidating everything of a type

```ts title="API Definition"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
import { Post, User } from './types'

export const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),
  tagTypes: ['Posts'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => 'posts',
      providesTags: (result) =>
        result ? result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Posts', id })) : ['Posts'],
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post>>({
      query: (body) => ({
        url: `posts`,
        method: 'POST',
        body,
      }),
      invalidatesTags: ['Posts'],
    }),
    getPost: build.query<Post, number>({
      query: (id) => `posts/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Posts', id }],
    }),
  }),
})

export const { useGetPostsQuery, useGetPostQuery, useAddPostMutation } = api
```

```tsx title="App.tsx"
function App() {
  const { data: posts } = useGetPostsQuery()
  const [addPost] = useAddPostMutation()

  return (
    <div>
      <AddPost onAdd={addPost} />
      <PostsList />
      {/* Assume each PostDetail is subscribed via `const {data} = useGetPostQuery(id)` */}
      <PostDetail id={1} />
      <PostDetail id={2} />
      <PostDetail id={3} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What to expect**

When `addPost` is triggered, it would cause each `PostDetail` component to go back into a `isFetching` state because `addPost` invalidates the root tag, which causes _every query_ that provides 'Posts' to be re-run. In most cases, this may not be what you want to do. Imagine if you had 100 posts on the screen that all subscribed to a `getPost` query – in this case, you'd create 100 requests and send a ton of unnecessary traffic to your server, which we're trying to avoid in the first place! Even though the user would still see the last good cached result and potentially not notice anything other than their browser hiccuping, you still want to avoid this.

#### Selectively invalidating lists

```ts title="API Definition"
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
import { Post, User } from './types'

export const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: '/' }),
  tagTypes: ['Posts'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => 'posts',
      providesTags: (result) =>
        result
          ? [
              ...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Posts' as const, id })),
              { type: 'Posts', id: 'LIST' },
            ]
          : [{ type: 'Posts', id: 'LIST' }],
    }),
    addPost: build.mutation<Post, Partial<Post>>({
      query(body) {
        return {
          url: `posts`,
          method: 'POST',
          body,
        }
      },
      invalidatesTags: [{ type: 'Posts', id: 'LIST' }],
    }),
    getPost: build.query<Post, number>({
      query: (id) => `posts/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) => [{ type: 'Posts', id }],
    }),
  }),
})

export const { useGetPostsQuery, useAddPostMutation, useGetPostQuery } = api
```

```tsx title="App.tsx"
function App() {
  const { data: posts } = useGetPostsQuery()
  const [addPost] = useAddPostMutation()

  return (
    <div>
      <AddPost onAdd={addPost} />
      <PostsList />
      {/* Assume each PostDetail is subscribed via `const {data} = useGetPostQuery(id)` */}
      <PostDetail id={1} />
      <PostDetail id={2} />
      <PostDetail id={3} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

**What to expect**

When `addPost` is fired, it will only cause the `PostsList` to go into an `isFetching` state because `addPost` only invalidates the `'LIST'` id, which causes `getPosts` to rerun (because it provides that specific id). So in your network tab, you would only see 1 new request fire for `GET /posts`. As the singular `getPost` queries have not been invalidated, they will not re-run as a result of `addPost`.

> **Note**
>
> If you intend for the `addPost` mutation to refresh all posts including individual `PostDetail` components while still only making 1 new `GET /posts` request, this can be done by selecting a part of the data using [`selectFromResult`](../rtk-query/queries/#selecting-data-from-a-query-result).

### Providing errors to the cache

The information provided to the cache is not limited to successful data fetches. The concept can be used to inform RTK Query that when a particular failure has been encountered, to `provide` a specific `tag` for that failed cache data. A separate endpoint can then `invalidate` the data for that `tag`, telling RTK Query to re-attempt the previously failed endpoints if a component is still subscribed to the failed data.

The example below demonstrates an example with the following behaviour:

- Provides an `UNAUTHORIZED` cache tag if a query fails with an error code of `401 UNAUTHORIZED`
- Provides an `UNKNOWN_ERROR` cache tag if a query fails with a different error
- Enables a 'login' mutation, which when _successful_, will `invalidate` the data with the `UNAUTHORIZED` tag.  
  This will trigger the `postById` endpoint to re-fire if:
  1. The last call for `postById` had encountered an unauthorized error, and
  2. A component is still subscribed to the cached data
- Enables a 'refetchErroredQueries' mutation which when _called_, will `invalidate` the data with the `UNKNOWN_ERROR` tag.  
  This will trigger the `postById` endpoint to re-fire if:
  1. The last call for `postById` had encountered an unknown error, and
  2. A component is still subscribed to the cached data

```ts
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}
export interface LoginResponse {}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, LoginResponse } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: 'http://example.com' }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'UNAUTHORIZED', 'UNKNOWN_ERROR'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    postById: build.query<Post, number>({
      query: (id) => `post/${id}`,
      providesTags: (result, error, id) =>
        result
          ? [{ type: 'Post', id }]
          : error?.status === 401
          ? ['UNAUTHORIZED']
          : ['UNKNOWN_ERROR'],
    }),
    login: build.mutation<LoginResponse, void>({
      query: () => '/login',
      // on successful login, will refetch all currently
      // 'UNAUTHORIZED' queries
      invalidatesTags: (result) => (result ? ['UNAUTHORIZED'] : []),
    }),
    refetchErroredQueries: build.mutation<null, void>({
      queryFn: () => ({ data: null }),
      invalidatesTags: ['UNKNOWN_ERROR'],
    }),
  }),
})
```

### Abstracting common provides/invalidates usage

The code written to `provide` & `invalidate` tags for a given `api` will be dependent on multiple factors, including:

- The shape of the data returned by your backend
- Which tags you expect a given query endpoint to provide
- Which tags you expect a given mutation endpoint to invalidate
- The extent that you wish to use the invalidation feature for

When declaring your `api`, you may feel as though you're duplicating your code. For instance, for two separate endpoints that both provide a list of a particular entity, the `providesTags` declaration may only differ in the `tagType` provided.

e.g.

```ts
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: 'http://example.com' }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query<Post[], void>({
      query: () => `posts`,
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: (result) =>
        result
          ? [
              { type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' },
              ...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'Post' as const, id })),
            ]
          : [{ type: 'Post', id: 'LIST' }],
      // highlight-end
    }),
    getUsers: build.query<User[], void>({
      query: () => `users`,
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: (result) =>
        result
          ? [
              { type: 'User', id: 'LIST' },
              ...result.map(({ id }) => ({ type: 'User' as const, id })),
            ]
          : [{ type: 'User', id: 'LIST' }],
      // highlight-end
    }),
  }),
})
```

You may find it beneficial to define helper functions designed for your particular api to reduce this boilerplate across endpoint definitions, e.g.

```ts
// file: types.ts noEmit
export interface Post {
  id: number
  name: string
}

export interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
}

// file: api.ts
import { createApi, fetchBaseQuery } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query'
import { Post, User } from './types'

// highlight-start
function providesList<R extends { id: string | number }[], T extends string>(
  resultsWithIds: R | undefined,
  tagType: T
) {
  return resultsWithIds
    ? [
        { type: tagType, id: 'LIST' },
        ...resultsWithIds.map(({ id }) => ({ type: tagType, id })),
      ]
    : [{ type: tagType, id: 'LIST' }]
}
// highlight-end

const api = createApi({
  baseQuery: fetchBaseQuery({ baseUrl: 'http://example.com' }),
  tagTypes: ['Post', 'User'],
  endpoints: (build) => ({
    getPosts: build.query({
      query: () => `posts`,
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: (result) => providesList(result, 'Post'),
      // highlight-end
    }),
    getUsers: build.query({
      query: () => `users`,
      // highlight-start
      providesTags: (result) => providesList(result, 'User'),
      // highlight-end
    }),
  }),
})
```
