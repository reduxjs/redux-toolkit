# `configureStore`

The standard method for creating a Redux store. It uses the low-level Redux core `createStore` method internally, but wraps that to provide good defaults to the store setup for a better development experience.

## Purpose and Behavior

A standard Redux store setup typically requires multiple pieces of configuration:

- Combining the slice reducers into the root reducer
- Creating the middleware enhancer, usually with the thunk middleware or other side effects middleware, as well as middleware that might be used for development checks
- Adding the Redux DevTools enhancer, and composing the enhancers together
- Calling `createStore`

Legacy Redux usage patterns typically required several dozen lines of copy-pasted boilerplate to achieve this.

Redux Toolkit's `configureStore` simplifies that setup process, by doing all that work for you. One call to `configureStore` will:

- Call `combineReducers` to combine your slices reducers into the root reducer function
- Add the thunk middleware and called `applyMiddleware`
- In development, automatically add more middleware to check for common mistakes like accidentally mutating the state
- Automatically set up the Redux DevTools Extension connection
- Call `createStore` to create a Redux store using that root reducer and those configuration options

`configureStore` also offers an improved API and usage patterns compared to the original `createStore` by accepting named fields for `reducer`, `preloadedState`, `middleware`, `enhancers`, and `devtools`, as well as much better TS type inference.

## Parameters

`configureStore` accepts a single configuration object parameter, with the following options:

```ts no-transpile

interface ConfigureStoreOptions<
  S = any,
  A extends Action = UnknownAction,
  M extends Tuple<Middlewares<S>> = Tuple<Middlewares<S>>
  E extends Tuple<Enhancers> = Tuple<Enhancers>,
  P = S
> {
  /**
   * A single reducer function that will be used as the root reducer, or an
   * object of slice reducers that will be passed to `combineReducers()`.
   */
  reducer: Reducer<S, A, P> | ReducersMapObject<S, A, P>

  /**
   * An array of Redux middleware to install. If not supplied, defaults to
   * the set of middleware returned by `getDefaultMiddleware()`.
   */
  middleware?: ((getDefaultMiddleware: CurriedGetDefaultMiddleware<S>) => M) | M

  /**
   * Whether to enable Redux DevTools integration. Defaults to `true`.
   *
   * Additional configuration can be done by passing Redux DevTools options
   */
  devTools?: boolean | DevToolsOptions

  /**
   * The initial state, same as Redux's createStore.
   * You may optionally specify it to hydrate the state
   * from the server in universal apps, or to restore a previously serialized
   * user session. If you use `combineReducers()` to produce the root reducer
   * function (either directly or indirectly by passing an object as `reducer`),
   * this must be an object with the same shape as the reducer map keys.
   */
  preloadedState?: P

  /**
   * The store enhancers to apply. See Redux's `createStore()`.
   * All enhancers will be included before the DevTools Extension enhancer.
   * If you need to customize the order of enhancers, supply a callback
   * function that will receive the getDefaultEnhancers,
   * and should return a new array (such as `getDefaultEnhancers().concat(offline)`).
   * If you only need to add middleware, you can use the `middleware` parameter instead.
   */
  enhancers?: (getDefaultEnhancers: GetDefaultEnhancers<M>) => E | E
}

function configureStore<
  S = any,
  A extends Action = UnknownAction,
  M extends Tuple<Middlewares<S>> = Tuple<Middlewares<S>>
  E extends Tuple<Enhancers> = Tuple<Enhancers>,
  P = S
>(options: ConfigureStoreOptions<S, A, M, E, P>): EnhancedStore<S, A, M, E>
```

### `reducer`

If this is a single function, it will be directly used as the root reducer for the store.

If it is an object of slice reducers, like `{users : usersReducer, posts : postsReducer}`,
`configureStore` will automatically create the root reducer by passing this object to the
[Redux `combineReducers` utility](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers).

### `middleware`

A callback which will receive `getDefaultMiddleware` as its argument,
and should return a middleware array.

If this option is provided, it should return all the middleware functions you
want added to the store. `configureStore` will automatically pass those to `applyMiddleware`.

If not provided, `configureStore` will call `getDefaultMiddleware` and use the
array of middleware functions it returns.

For more details on how the `middleware` parameter works and the list of middleware that are added by default, see the
[`getDefaultMiddleware` docs page](./getDefaultMiddleware.mdx).

:::note Tuple
Typescript users are required to use a `Tuple` instance (if not using a `getDefaultMiddleware` result, which is already a `Tuple`), for better inference.

```ts no-transpile
import { configureStore, Tuple } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  middleware: () => new Tuple(additionalMiddleware, logger),
})
```

Javascript-only users are free to use a plain array if preferred.

:::

### `devTools`

If this is a boolean, it will be used to indicate whether `configureStore` should automatically enable support for [the Redux DevTools browser extension](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools).

If it is an object, then the DevTools Extension will be enabled, and the options object will be passed to `composeWithDevtools()`. See
the DevTools Extension docs for [`EnhancerOptions`](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/blob/main/extension/docs/API/Arguments.md) for
a list of the specific options that are available.

Defaults to `true`.

#### `trace`

The Redux DevTools Extension recently added [support for showing action stack traces](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/blob/main/extension/docs/Features/Trace.md) that show exactly where each action was dispatched.
Capturing the traces can add a bit of overhead, so the DevTools Extension allows users to configure whether action stack traces are captured by [setting the 'trace' argument](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools/blob/main/extension/docs/API/Arguments.md#trace).
If the DevTools are enabled by passing `true` or an object, then `configureStore` will default to enabling capturing action stack traces in development mode only.

### `preloadedState`

An optional initial state value to be passed to the Redux `createStore` function.

### `enhancers`

An optional array of Redux store enhancers, or a callback function to customize the array of enhancers.

If defined as an array, these will be passed to [the Redux `compose` function](https://redux.js.org/api/compose), and the combined enhancer will be passed to `createStore`.

:::tip Dev Tools
This should _not_ include the Redux DevTools Extension `composeWithDevTools`, as this is already handled by `configureStore`.

Example: `enhancers: new Tuple(offline)` will result in a final setup of `[offline, devToolsExtension]`.

If not provided, `configureStore` will call `getDefaultEnhancers` and use the array of enhancers it returns (including `applyMiddleware` with specified middleware).

Where you wish to add onto or customize the default enhancers, you may pass a callback function that will receive `getDefaultEnhancers` as its argument, and should return an enhancer array.

Example: `enhancers: (defaultEnhancers) => defaultEnhancers.prepend(offline)` will result in a final setup
of `[offline, applyMiddleware, devToolsExtension]`.

For more details on how the `enhancer` parameter works and the list of enhancers that are added by default, see the [`getDefaultEnhancers` docs page](./getDefaultEnhancers).

:::caution Middleware

If you provide an array, this `applyMiddleware` enhancer will _not_ be used.

`configureStore` will warn in console if any middleware are provided (or left as default) but not included in the final list of enhancers.

```ts no-transpile
// warns - middleware customised but not included in final enhancers
configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger)
  enhancers: [offline(offlineConfig)],
})

// fine - default enhancers included
configureStore({
  reducer,
  enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) => getDefaultEnhancers().concat(offline(offlineConfig)),
})

// also allowed
configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: () => [],
  enhancers: ()  => [offline(offlineConfig)],
})
```

:::

:::note Tuple
Typescript users are required to use a `Tuple` instance (if not using a `getDefaultEnhancer` result, which is already a `Tuple`), for better inference.

```
import { configureStore, Tuple } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

configureStore({
reducer: rootReducer,
enhancers: () => new Tuple(offline),
})

```

Javascript-only users are free to use a plain array if preferred.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```ts
// file: reducers.ts noEmit
import type { Reducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
declare const rootReducer: Reducer<{}>
export default rootReducer

// file: store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

import rootReducer from './reducers'

const store = configureStore({ reducer: rootReducer })
// The store now has redux-thunk added and the Redux DevTools Extension is turned on
```

### Full Example

```ts no-transpile
// file: todos/todosReducer.ts noEmit
import type { Reducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
declare const reducer: Reducer<{}>
export default reducer

// file: visibility/visibilityReducer.ts noEmit
import type { Reducer } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
declare const reducer: Reducer<{}>
export default reducer

// file: store.ts
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

// We'll use redux-logger just as an example of adding another middleware
import logger from 'redux-logger'

// And use redux-batched-subscribe as an example of adding enhancers
import { batchedSubscribe } from 'redux-batched-subscribe'

import todosReducer from './todos/todosReducer'
import visibilityReducer from './visibility/visibilityReducer'

const reducer = {
  todos: todosReducer,
  visibility: visibilityReducer,
}

const preloadedState = {
  todos: [
    {
      text: 'Eat food',
      completed: true,
    },
    {
      text: 'Exercise',
      completed: false,
    },
  ],
  visibilityFilter: 'SHOW_COMPLETED',
}

const debounceNotify = _.debounce((notify) => notify())

const store = configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: (getDefaultMiddleware) => getDefaultMiddleware().concat(logger),
  devTools: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
  preloadedState,
  enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) =>
    getDefaultEnhancers({
      autoBatch: false,
    }).concat(batchedSubscribe(debounceNotify)),
})

// The store has been created with these options:
// - The slice reducers were automatically passed to combineReducers()
// - redux-thunk and redux-logger were added as middleware
// - The Redux DevTools Extension is disabled for production
// - The middleware, batched subscribe, and devtools enhancers were composed together
```
