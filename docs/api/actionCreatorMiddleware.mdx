# Action Creator Middleware

A custom middleware that detects if an action creator has been mistakenly dispatched, instead of being called before dispatching.

A common mistake is to call `dispatch(actionCreator)` instead of `dispatch(actionCreator())`.
This tends to "work" as the action creator has the static `type` property, but can lead to unexpected behavior.

## Options

```ts no-transpile
export interface ActionCreatorInvariantMiddlewareOptions {
  /**
   * The function to identify whether a value is an action creator.
   * The default checks for a function with a static type property and match method.
   */
  isActionCreator?: (action: unknown) => action is Function & { type?: unknown }
}
```

## Exports

### `createActionCreatorInvariantMiddleware`

Creates an instance of the action creator check middleware, with the given options.

You will most likely not need to call this yourself, as `getDefaultMiddleware` already does so.
Example:

```ts
// file: reducer.ts noEmit

export default function (state = {}, action: any) {
  return state
}

// file: store.ts

import {
  configureStore,
  createActionCreatorInvariantMiddleware,
  Tuple,
} from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import reducer from './reducer'

// Augment middleware to consider all functions with a static type property to be action creators
const isActionCreator = (
  action: unknown,
): action is (...args: any) => any & { type: unknown } =>
  typeof action === 'function' && 'type' in action

const actionCreatorMiddleware = createActionCreatorInvariantMiddleware({
  isActionCreator,
})

const store = configureStore({
  reducer,
  middleware: () => new Tuple(actionCreatorMiddleware),
})
```
