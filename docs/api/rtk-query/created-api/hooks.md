# API Slices: React Hooks

## Hooks Overview

The core RTK Query `createApi` method is UI-agnostic, in the same way that the Redux core library and Redux Toolkit are UI-agnostic. They are all plain JS logic that can be used anywhere.

However, RTK Query also provides the ability to auto-generate React hooks for each of your endpoints. Since this specifically depends on React itself, RTK Query provides an alternate entry point that exposes a customized version of `createApi` that includes that functionality:

```js
import { createApi } from '@reduxjs/toolkit/query/react'
```

If you have used the React-specific version of `createApi`, the generated `Api` slice structure will also contain a set of React hooks. The primary endpoint hooks are available as `api.endpoints[endpointName].useQuery` or `api.endpoints[endpointName].useMutation`, matching how you defined that endpoint.

The same hooks are also added to the `Api` object itself, and given auto-generated names based on the endpoint name and query/mutation type.

For example, if you had endpoints for `getPosts` and `updatePost`, these options would be available:

```ts title="Generated React Hook names"
// Hooks attached to the endpoint definition
const { data } = api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuery()
const [updatePost, { data }] = api.endpoints.updatePost.useMutation()

// Same hooks, but given unique names and attached to the API slice object
const { data } = api.useGetPostsQuery()
const [updatePost, { data }] = api.useUpdatePostMutation()
```

The general format is `use(Endpointname)(Query|Mutation)` - `use` is prefixed, the first letter of your endpoint name is capitalized, then `Query` or `Mutation` is appended depending on the type.

The full list of hooks generated in the React-specific version of `createApi` is as follows:

- `useQuery` (endpoint-specific)
- `useMutation` (endpoint-specific)
- `useQueryState` (endpoint-specific)
- `useQuerySubscription` (endpoint-specific)
- `useLazyQuery` (endpoint-specific)
- `usePrefetch` (endpoint-agnostic)

For the example above, the full set of generated hooks for the api would be like so:

```ts title="Generated React Hooks"
/* Hooks attached to the `getPosts` query endpoint definition */
const { data } = api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuery(arg, options)
const post = api.endpoints.getPosts.useQueryState(arg, options)
const { refetch } = api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuerySubscription(arg, options)
const [getPosts, { data }, { lastArg }] = api.endpoints.getPosts.useLazyQuery(
  options
)
const [getPosts, lastArg] = api.endpoints.getPosts.useLazyQuerySubscription(
  options
)

/* Hooks attached to the `updatePost` mutation endpoint definition */
const [updatePost, { data }] = api.endpoints.updatePost.useMutation(options)

/* Hooks attached to the `Api` object */
// same as api.endpoints.getPosts.useQuery
const { data } = api.useGetPostsQuery(arg, options)
// same as api.endpoints.getPosts.useLazyQuery
const [getPosts, { data }, { lastArg }] = api.useLazyGetPostsQuery(options)
// same as api.endpoints.updatePost.useMutation
const [updatePost, { data }] = api.useUpdatePostMutation(options)
const fetchData = api.usePrefetch(endpointName, options)
```

## `useQuery`

#### Signature

```ts
type UseQuery = (arg: any, options?: UseQueryOptions) => UseQueryResult

type UseQueryOptions = {
  pollingInterval?: number
  refetchOnReconnect?: boolean
  refetchOnFocus?: boolean
  skip?: boolean
  refetchOnMountOrArgChange?: boolean | number
  selectFromResult?: QueryStateSelector
}

type UseQueryResult<T> = {
  // Base query state
  originalArgs?: unknown // Arguments passed to the query
  data?: T // Returned result if present
  error?: unknown // Error result if present
  requestId?: string // A string generated by RTK Query
  endpointName?: string // The name of the given endpoint for the query
  startedTimeStamp?: number // Timestamp for when the query was initiated
  fulfilledTimeStamp?: number // Timestamp for when the query was completed

  isUninitialized: false // Query has not started yet.
  isLoading: false // Query is currently loading for the first time. No data yet.
  isFetching: false // Query is currently fetching, but might have data from an earlier request.
  isSuccess: false // Query has data from a successful load.
  isError: false // Query is currently in an "error" state.

  refetch: () => void // A function to force refetch the query
}
```

- **Parameters**
  - `arg`: The query argument to be used in constructing the query itself, and as a cache key for the query
  - `options`: A set of options that control the fetching behavior of the hook
- **Returns**
  - A query result object containing the current loading state, the actual data or error returned from the API call, metadata about the request, and a function to `refetch` the data. Can be customized with `selectFromResult`

## `useMutation`

#### Signature

```ts
type UseMutation = (
  options?: UseMutationStateOptions
) => [UseMutationTrigger, UseMutationResult | SelectedUseMutationResult]

type UseMutationStateOptions = {
  // A method to determine the contents of `UseMutationResult`
  selectFromResult?: (state, defaultMutationStateSelector) => SelectedUseMutationResult extends Record<string, any>
}

type UseMutationTrigger<T> = (
  arg: any
) => Promise<{ data: T } | { error: BaseQueryError | SerializedError }> & {
  requestId: string // A string generated by RTK Query
  abort: () => void // A method to cancel the mutation promise
  unwrap: () => Promise<T> // A method to unwrap the mutation call and provide the raw response/error
  unsubscribe: () => void // A method to manually unsubscribe from the mutation call
}

type UseMutationResult<T> = {
  data?: T // Returned result if present
  endpointName?: string // The name of the given endpoint for the mutation
  error?: unknown // Error result if present
  fulfilledTimestamp?: number // Timestamp for when the mutation was completed
  isError: boolean // Mutation is currently in an "error" state
  isLoading: boolean // Mutation has been fired and is awaiting a response
  isSuccess: boolean // Mutation has data from a successful call
  isUninitialized: boolean // Mutation has not been fired yet
  originalArgs?: unknown // Arguments passed to the latest mutation call
  startedTimeStamp?: number // Timestamp for when the latest mutation was initiated
}
```

:::tip

The generated `UseMutation` hook will cause a component to re-render by default after the trigger callback is fired, as it affects the properties of the result. If you want to call the trigger but don't care about subscribing to the result with the hook, you can use the `selectFromResult` option to limit the properties that the hook cares about.

Returning a completely empty object will mean that any individual mutation call will cause only one re-render at most, e.g.

```ts
selectFromResult: () => ({})
```

:::

- **Parameters**

  - `options`: A set of options that control the subscription behavior of the hook

- **Returns**: A tuple containing:
  - `trigger`: A function that triggers an update to the data based on the provided argument. The trigger function returns a promise with the properties shown above that may be used to handle the behavior of the promise
  - `mutationState`: A query status object containing the current loading state and metadata about the request, or the values returned by the `selectFromResult` option where applicable
