# `getDefaultEnhancers`

Returns an array containing the default list of enhancers.

## Intended Usage

By default, [`configureStore`](./configureStore.mdx) adds some enhancers to the Redux store setup automatically.

```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
})

// Store has enhancers added, because the enhancer list was not customized
```

If you want to customise the list of enhancers, you can supply an array of enhancer functions to `configureStore`:

```js
const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: [offline(offlineConfig)],
})

// store specifically has the offline enhancer applied
```

However, when you supply the `enhancer` option, you are responsible for defining _all_ the enhancers you want added
to the store (with the exception of the [devtools](./configureStore#devtools)). `configureStore` will not add any extra enhancers beyond what you listed, **including the middleware enhancer**.

`getDefaultEnhancers` is useful if you want to add some custom enhancers, but also still want to have the default
enhancers added as well:

```ts no-transpile
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import { offline } from '@redux-offline/redux-offline'
import offlineConfig from '@redux-offline/redux-offline/lib/defaults'

import rootReducer from './reducer'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) =>
    getDefaultEnhancers().concat(offline(offlineConfig)),
})

// Store has all of the default middleware + enhancers added, _plus_ the offline enhancer
```

## Included Default Enhancers

The resulting array will always contain the `applyMiddleware` enhancer created based on the `configureStore`'s `middleware` field.

Additionally, the [`autoBatchEnhancer`](./autoBatchEnhancer.mdx) is included, to allow for "batching" of low priority action updates. This is used by [RTK Query](/rtk-query/overview.md) and should improve performance when using it.

Currently, the return value is

```js
const enhancers = [applyMiddleware, autoBatchEnhancer]
```

## Customising the Included Enhancers

`getDefaultEnhancers` accepts an options object that allows customizing each enhancer (excluding the middleware enhancer) in two ways:

- Each enhancer can be excluded from the result array by passing `false` for its corresponding field
- Each enhancer can have its options customized by passing the matching options object for its corresponding field

This example shows customising the autoBatch enhancer:

```ts
// file: reducer.ts noEmit

export default function rootReducer(state = {}, action: any) {
  return state
}

// file: store.ts
import rootReducer from './reducer'
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const store = configureStore({
  reducer: rootReducer,
  enhancers: (getDefaultEnhancers) =>
    getDefaultEnhancers({
      autoBatch: { type: 'tick' },
    }),
})
```

## API Reference

```ts no-transpile
interface AutoBatchOptions {
  // see "autoBatchEnhancer" page for options
}

interface GetDefaultEnhancersOptions {
  autoBatch?: boolean | AutoBatchOptions
}

function getDefaultEnhancers<M extends Middlewares<any>>(
  options: GetDefaultEnhancersOptions = {},
): EnhancerArray<[StoreEnhancer<{ dispatch: ExtractDispatchExtensions<M> }>]>
```
