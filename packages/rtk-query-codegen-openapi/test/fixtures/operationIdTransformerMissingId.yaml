  title: operationIdTransformer missing operationId fixture
  description: >
    Fixture for testing that `operationIdTransformer: "none"` and custom
    transformer functions throw an informative error when an operation is
    missing its `operationId`. The single `GET /pet` endpoint intentionally
    omits `operationId` to trigger this error path. The `"camelCase"` default
    should handle this gracefully by deriving a name from the HTTP verb and
    path instead.
