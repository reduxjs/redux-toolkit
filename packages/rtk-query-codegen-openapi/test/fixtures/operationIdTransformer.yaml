  title: operationIdTransformer fixture
  description: >
    Fixture for testing the `operationIdTransformer` option.
    Includes operationIds with consecutive uppercase letters
    (e.g. `fetchMyJWTPlease`, `updatePETScan`) to verify that
    transformers like `"none"` preserve them verbatim while the
    default `"camelCase"` normalizes them to `fetchMyJwtPlease`
    and `updatePetScan`.

      description: Regular camelCase operationId — should be unaffected by any transformer.

    get:
      operationId: fetchMyJWTPlease
      summary: Fetch a JWT token
      description: >
        operationId contains consecutive uppercase letters (`JWT`).
        With `"camelCase"` this becomes `fetchMyJwtPlease`;
        with `"none"` it stays `fetchMyJWTPlease`.

        '200':

      summary: Replace a JWT token
      description: >
        operationId contains consecutive uppercase letters (`JWT`).
        Used to verify that mutations are also renamed consistently.

      description: >
        operationId contains a different consecutive-uppercase sequence (`PET`).
        Used alongside `fetchMyJWTPlease` to confirm the transformer is applied
        uniformly across all operations.
