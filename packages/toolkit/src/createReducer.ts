/**
 * A utility function that allows defining a reducer as a mapping from action
 * type to *case reducer* functions that handle these action types. The
 * reducer's initial state is passed as the first argument.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The body of every case reducer is implicitly wrapped with a call to
 * `produce()` from the [immer](https://github.com/mweststrate/immer) library.
 * This means that rather than returning a new state object, you can also
 * mutate the passed-in state object directly; these mutations will then be
 * automatically and efficiently translated into copies, giving you both
 * convenience and immutability.
 *
 * @overloadSummary
 * This function accepts a callback that receives a `builder` object as its argument.
 * That builder provides `addCase`, `addMatcher` and `addDefaultCase` functions that may be
 * called to define what actions this reducer will handle.
 *
 * @param initialState - `State | (() => State)`: The initial state that should be used when the reducer is called the first time. This may also be a "lazy initializer" function, which should return an initial state value when called. This will be used whenever the reducer is called with `undefined` as its state value, and is primarily useful for cases like reading initial state from `localStorage`.
 * @param builderCallback - `(builder: Builder) => void` A callback that receives a *builder* object to define
 *   case reducers via calls to `builder.addCase(actionCreatorOrType, reducer)`.
 * @example
```ts
import {
  createAction,
  createReducer,
  UnknownAction,
  PayloadAction,
} from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const increment = createAction<number>("increment");
const decrement = createAction<number>("decrement");

      .addCase(increment, (state, action) => {
        // action is inferred correctly here
        state.counter += action.payload;
      })
      // You can chain calls, or have separate `builder.addCase()` lines each time
      .addCase(decrement, (state, action) => {
        state.counter -= action.payload;
      })
      // You can apply a "matcher function" to incoming actions
      .addMatcher(isActionWithNumberPayload, (state, action) => {})
      // and provide a default case if no other handlers matched
      .addDefaultCase((state, action) => {});
